# Create a program to analyze 
# a large block of text and report 
# back on the frequency of each word in the text.

# Start by storing the text within a hash where each 
# word is a key with the word's value being the amount 
# of times it has been used in the block:
# ruby {the: 10, john: 1, of: 15}

# Once you've created this hash, 
# return the word that has been used the most

# When you're done, encapsulate your script inside of a method that can analyze any block of text fed to it

I must master it as I must master mylife.My content, without me, is useless. Without my content, I am useless. I must fire my content true. My content is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its sights and its barrel. I will keep my content clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will..."
